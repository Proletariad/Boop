# Boop

An SDK for building combat routines for Retail World of Warcraft with NoName. Heavily influenced by "Bastion".

## Installation

Clone or download this repository into your NN "scripts" folder. Then create a new file in that same script folder called `_load.lua` (or anything really, as long as it has a `_` in front of it), and in that file paste this code:

```lua
local NN = ... 

NN:Require('/scripts/Boop/main.lua')
```

Now, when you boot up the game with NoName it will auto-load Boop.

## Usage

This is not a suite of high performing rotations. This repo will contain some rotations that I have personally developed and use, and while you're welcome to use them the point of this project is to better enable you and the rest of the NoName community to build their own rotations.

## Development

Feel free to fork this repo and build your own version, or submit issues and PRs to improve it.

Docs coming eventually.
